## About

This library is a menagerie of odd ball extensions, utilities and helpers gleamed from blogs, books, stack exchange answers, confrence talks, etc. that do not quite belong in the standard Swift library.  Either there are good arguements for things to be excluded, or they are just far from the scope of what belongs in a standard lib.

Make a pull request.  If I think it's neat, I'll take it.   

## License

There isn't one, and I'm not going to bother listing any of the anti-license licenses.  These are adapted from other sources I'm not going to bother to keep track of which were not even posted in a licensed way.  Use this at your own peril, or don't.
